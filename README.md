<h3>Concept of the Hangman Game</h3>
<h4>Start</h4>
<p>In the Hangman game, players choose a theme that can be random or specified, such as fruits, sports, countries, etc. Then, players must guess the hidden word by suggesting letters.</p>
<h4>Hint</h4>
<p>If a player decides to use a hint, they will receive fewer points for a correct answer. However, for each incorrect letter, the player will lose more points. This adds a strategic element to the game, as players must decide whether to use a hint or take the risk to earn more points</p>

<h4>Win</h4>
<p>After the player correctly guesses the word, they will have the option to enter their name. This name will be displayed in the players' leaderboard alongside the date, score, and name. Players will be ranked based on their scores: the higher the score, the higher the position in the table.</p>
<h4>Lose</h4>
<p>If the player fails to guess the word and loses, they will have the option to try again. This encourages players not to give up and to seek their luck in the next round.</p>
